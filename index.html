            <i>
              In a whimsical town, there exists a candy factory like no other, run by the enigmatic and slightly eerie Wanka. Children are lured in by the promise of sugary delights, only to discover that this factory harbors mischievous and mildly spooky surprises. The Oompa-Loompas, now mischievous Impa-Ghoulpas, sing playful yet eerie tunes as they guide the children through misadventures involving haunted sweets and candy creatures. Wanka, with a mischievous grin, reveals his haunted confections, turning the factory tour into a lighthearted journey through a deliciously creepy world. It's a spooky and silly twist on the classic tale, where the scares are as sweet as the treats themselves.
